## Changelog

## v1.6.2

Remove alpha-hiding during scale settle (could leave frame invisible in edge cases).

Add short preview pulse after restore so you can always spot the frame even when locked.

Minor safety tweaks & logs.

## v1.6.1

Fix rare Lua error when scale events fired before the frame existed (attempt to index upvalue 'frame').

Create frame on demand in all paths; guard settings UI sync when frame may be nil.

## v1.6.0

New scale-settle restore: wait until UI scale stops changing (or matches saved target) before placing the frame — prevents visible jumps with UI scaling addons.

Save the effective scale at drop time and target that scale on restore.

Keep persistent debug logging (/idtooltip debug on|off).

One clean restore + optional fade logic (later removed in 1.6.2).

## v1.5.1

Fix Lua syntax error (} else {) introduced in 1.5.0.

Keep center-based save + BL restore pipeline.

## v1.5.0

Switch to center-based, pixel-snapped saving and absolute BOTTOMLEFT restoring for maximum stability across reloads, scales, and resolutions.

Persist debug setting across reloads; add /idtooltip restore for manual testing.

Backward-compatible: convert old bottom-left % saves to center % once.

## v1.4.0

Add robust late restore scheduling:

Run on PLAYER_ENTERING_WORLD, next frame, and +0.05s to catch initial layout.

Mark frame UserPlaced (SetUserPlaced(true)) to prevent layout nudges.

Add /idtooltip debug on|off with precise save/restore logs.

## v1.3.0

Make save/restore scale-safe using effective (physical pixel) coords.

Defer first restore to next frame to avoid drift after /reload.

## v1.2.1

Fix Retail Settings checkbox template usage (replaced SettingsCheckBoxTemplate .Text access with UICheckButtonTemplate + explicit label).

Name the width slider so its Low/High/Text regions exist and update properly.

## v1.2.0

Move to Dragonflight Settings UI (canvas category) for Retail.

Add options parity with slash commands: Locked, Show/Hide, Reset, Width slider.

Improve “unlocked edit mode”: when unlocked, frame stays visible, ignores tooltips, and can be dragged freely.

## v1.1.0

Add unlocked “edit mode” toggle via right-click (lock/unlock) with quick tooltip confirmation.

Add /idtooltip show|hide|reset commands.

Save and restore position across sessions.
